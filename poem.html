                <h2>1. Aim High to the Sky by James McDonald</h2>
                <p>Aim high to the sky,<br>
                    In all that you do.<br>
                    Because you just never know,<br>
                    What it takes to be you.<br>
                    <br>
                    Be strong and be brave,<br>
                    But at the same time be kind.<br>
                    And always be sure,<br>
                    That you’re using your mind.<br>
                </p><br>
                <h2>2. If You Can’t Go Over Or Under, Go Around by Joseph Morris</h2>
                <p>
                    A baby mole got to feeling big,<br>
                    And wanted to show how he could dig;<br>
                    So he plowed along in the soft, warm dirt<br>
                    Till he hit something hard, and it surely hurt!<br>
                    <br>
                    A dozen stars flew out of his snout;<br>
                    He sat on his haunches, began to pout;<br>
                    Then rammed the thing again with his head–<br>
                    His grandpap picked him up half dead.<br>
                    <br>
                    “Young man,” he said, “though your pate is bone.<br>
                    You can’t butt your way through solid stone.<br>
                    This bit of advice is good, I’ve found:<br>
                    If you can’t go over or under, go round.”<br>
                    <br>
                    A traveler came to a stream one day,<br>
                    And because it presumed to cross his way,<br>
                    And wouldn’t turn round to suit his whim<br>
                    And change its course to go with him,<br>
                    <br>
                    His anger rose far more than it should,<br>
                    And he vowed he’d cross right where he stood.<br>
                    A man said there was a bridge below,<br>
                    But not a step would he budge or go.<br>
                    <br>
                    The current was swift and the bank was steep,<br>
                    But he jumped right in with a violent leap.<br>
                    A fisherman dragged him out half-drowned:<br>
                    “When you can’t go over or under, go round.”<br>
                </p><br>
                <h2>3. Portia’s Speech by William Shakespeare</h2>
                <p>
                    The quality of mercy is not strain’d,<br>
                    It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven<br>
                    Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;<br>
                    It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes:<br>
                    <br>
                    ‘Tis mightiest in the mightiest” it becomes<br>
                    The throned monarch better than his crown;<br>
                    His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,<br>
                    The atrribute to awe and majesty,<br>
                    <br>
                    Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;<br>
                    But mercy is above this sceptred sway;<br>
                    It is enthroned to God himself;<br>
                    And earthly power doth then show likest God’s<br>
                    When mercy seasons justice.<br>
                </p><br>
                <h2>4. Evolution by John Banister Tabb</h2>
                <p>
                    Out of the dusk a shadow,<br>
                    Then, a spark;<br>
                    Out of the cloud a silence,<br>
                    Then, a lark;<br>
                    <br>
                    Out of the heart a rapture,<br>
                    Then, a pain;<br>
                    Out of the dead, cold ashes,<br>
                    Life again.<br>
                </p><br>
                <h2>5. Then Laugh by Bertha Adams Backus</h2>
                <p>
                    Build for yourself a strong box,<br>
                    Fashion each part with care;<br>
                    When it’s strong as your hand can make it,<br>
                    Put all your troubles there;<br>

                    Hide there all thought of your failures,<br>
                    And each bitter cup that you quaff;<br>
                    Lock all your heartaches within it,<br>
                    Then sit on the lid and laugh.<br>
