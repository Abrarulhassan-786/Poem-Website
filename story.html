            <h1 id="story1heading">THE GURDIANS OF LORE</h1>
            <p>While drawing in class at Stagwood School, 12-year old Cal sees a frog staring at him through the window.
                Stranger than that, is the fact that this frog happens to be wearing glasses.
                <br><br>
                Cal and his best friend, Soy, learn that the frog (who prefers the name Deli) has sought them out for a
                reason. When a school administrator named Ream reveals himself to be a dragon, the boys discover that
                fairytales are real, and that there is magic afoot in Stagwood. With Ream on their tail, the trio must
                unearth a powerful tool protected by riddles and rile (the magic that fuels nightmares) to save the fate
                of all fairytales past. But, before Cal can defeat Ream, he has to deal with Soy's knack for arguing
                with magical creatures, discover the truth about Deli's identity, and earn his place as the hero of the
                story. The Guardians of Lore is a middle grade novel that centers around two life-long friends, infusing
                humor and fantasy-based riddles into a modern fairytale.

            <p>Mr. McKay is a most mischievous fellow. His hair and eyes have been known to change color with the
                seasons. If you ever feel a warm breeze on a very cold winter day, be sure to keep your coat on, because
